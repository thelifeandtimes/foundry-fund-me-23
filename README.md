## Notes To Self

### 241220

I left off at the point of putting my contract dependency variables (i.e. the AggregatorV3Interface contract address) into my deployment script and then integrating my deployment script into my test suite. Because I'm retarded, I battled this for a minute thanks to a case sensitivity issue on my import statment. This is the kind of thing that would be solved for if I had path autocompletion turned on, so it's probably worth fixing that in the relatively near term.
